# Vagrantfile to setup a Kubernetes Cluster on Oracle Linux 7
This Vagrantfile will provision a Kubernetes cluster with one master and _n_
worker nodes (2 by default).

## Prerequisites
1. Install [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
1. Install [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com/)
1. Sign in to [Oracle Container Registry](https://container-registry.oracle.com)
and accept the _Oracle Standard Terms and Restrictions_ for the
_Container Services_ Business Area.

## Quick start
1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/oracle/vagrant-boxes`
1. Change into the `vagrant-boxes/Kubernetes` folder
1. Run `vagrant up master; vagrant ssh master`
1. Within the master guest, run as `root`:
`/vagrant/scripts/kubeadm-setup-master.sh`  
You will be asked to log in to the Oracle Container Registry
1. Run `vagrant up worker1; vagrant ssh worker1`
1. Within the worker1 guest, run as `root`:
`/vagrant/scripts/kubeadm-setup-worker.sh`  
You will be asked to log in to the Oracle Container Registry
1. Repeat the last 2 steps for worker2

Your cluster is ready!  
Within the master guest you can check the status of the cluster (as the
`vagrant` user). E.g.:
- `kubectl cluster-info`
- `kubectl get nodes`
- `kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system`

## About the Vagrantfile

The Vagrant provisioning script uses the _Oracle Linux 7 Preview channel_ for
both Docker Engine and Kubernetes.

The VMs communicate via a private network:

- Master node: 192.168.99.100 / master.vagrant.vm
- Worker node i: 192.168.99.(100+i) / worker_i_.vagrant.vm

The Vagrant provisioning script pre-loads Kubernetes and satisfies the
pre-requisites.
It does **not** run `kubeadm-setup.sh` as this requires authentication to the
[Oracle Container Registry](https://container-registry.oracle.com). This is
done by the `kubeadm-setup-master.sh` and `kubeadm-setup-worker.sh` helper
scripts.

## Configuration
The Vagrantfile can be used _as-is_; there are a couple of parameters you
can set to tailor the installation to your needs.

- `NB_WORKERS` (default: 2): the number of worker nodes to provision.
- `MANAGE_FROM_HOST` (default: `false`): when `true`, Vagrant will bind port
`6443` from the master node to the host.
This allows you to manage the cluster from the host itself using the generated
`admin.conf` file (assuming `kubectl` is installed on the host).
- `BIND_PROXY` (default: `true`): when `true`, Vagrant will bind the Kubernetes
Proxy port from the master node to the host. Useful to access the
Dashboard or any other application from _outside_ the cluster.
It is an easier alternative to ssh tunnel.
- `MEMORY` (default: 2048): all VMs are provisioned with 2GB memory. This
can be slightly reduced if memory is a concern.

## Optional plugins
You might want to install the following Vagrant plugins:
- [vagrant-hosts](https://github.com/oscar-stack/vagrant-hosts): maintains
/etc/hosts for the guest VMs;
- [vagrant-proxyconf](https://github.com/tmatilai/vagrant-proxyconf): set
proxies in the guest VMs if you need to access Internet through proxy. See
plugin documentation for the configuration.

Please provide feedback of any kind via Github issues on this repository.
